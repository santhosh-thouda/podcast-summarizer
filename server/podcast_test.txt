Podcast Title: The Future of AI – Episode 42

Host: Welcome back to TechTalks! Today we’re diving into the future of artificial intelligence. I'm your host, Sam.

Guest: And I’m Dr. Lisa Park, AI researcher at FutureLab. Excited to be here.

Host: Let’s start with the basics. How do you see AI evolving in the next five years?

Guest: Great question. I think we’ll see a shift from narrow AI—like chatbots—to more generalized systems. These won’t just respond to input but reason, adapt, and collaborate.

Host: That sounds huge. What industries will be impacted most?

Guest: Healthcare, education, and creative industries will see major transformations. For instance, AI could assist doctors with diagnostics or help educators personalize learning.

Host: There’s also concern about job losses. Thoughts?

Guest: It’s valid. While some roles may disappear, many new jobs will emerge. It’s about reskilling and adapting to new tools.

Host: Before we wrap up, one piece of advice for listeners?

Guest: Stay curious. Learn the basics of AI. The more we understand it, the better we can shape its future.

Host: Thank you, Dr. Lisa. And thanks to our listeners! Don’t forget to subscribe and share.
